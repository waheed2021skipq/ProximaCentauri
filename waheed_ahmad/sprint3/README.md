<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project we are deploying a pipeline that will automate the code deploy and test step Code Pipeline automates the build, test, and deploy phases of your release process every time there is a code change, based on the release model you define. This enables you to deliver features and updates rapidly and reliably.
